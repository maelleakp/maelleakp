### Hi 👋

I am a computer developer who is looking for an internship in a company for a period of 4 months from the end of April. During this internship, I would like to work for a company as a computer developer. Indeed, it would allow me to acquire quickly valuable skills and experience. 
I would like to invest myself in a job that makes sense, in which I feel useful and involved, for which the missions and objectives are fixed. 

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as well. If you have found value in something I have created, do not hesitate to contact me:

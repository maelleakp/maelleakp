### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a IT developer who is looking for an internship in a company for 4 months starting from the end of April. This internship would allow me to acquire quickly valuable skills and experience. 
I would like to invest myself in a job that makes sense, in which I feel useful and involved, for which the missions and objectives are fixed. 

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as well. If you have found value in something I have created, do not hesitate to contact me:
